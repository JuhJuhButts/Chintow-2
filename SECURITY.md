# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If there's a vulnerability within the bot, contact me at any of the emails associated with my commits (evansjoe002@icloud.com, joel@joelne.digital, etc). Especially if it's an important one, I'll keep you posted on resolutions for it as often as possible. I'll also address it in the description of the commit resolving it, and of course credit you for discovery (depending on the severety, I might reward you too). 

## Exploiting a Vuulnerability

Exploiting the bot in any way is forbidden. Whether it's in good spirits or not, you will be punished accordingly for taking destructive actions against me, the bot, my host server, the Discord server, and/or other users.
