# Vagan

A bot designed for Killer Bean Club (https://discord.gg/BgGhHUQ)

## How to Contribute

Any help with developing the bot is greatly appreciated. You don't have to learn programming to help around, small things like providing suggestions, commenting on issues/pull requests, etc. are also ways to contribute.

### Basics

As noted above, you can contribute to the bot by

-Commenting on issues/pull requests
-Creating issues or starting discussions
-Emailing me

### Programming

If you know JavaScript or want to learn it, discord.js is a great place to start (it's where I did). Some helpful guides can be found at https://discordjs.guide and https://anidiots.guide. For more technical stuff, the documentation is on https://discord.js.org.
Even if you've just started with djs, you can still look at my code and learn from there, point out mistakes, make suggestions, and ask questions. To directly make a suggestion to edit code, you can [make a pull request](https://github.com/JuhJuhButts/Vagan/pulls/new) (the way this would work is you make a new branch in the repo, edit that branch, then request to merge those change into the main branch).
